# Instock

The goal was to deliver an Inventory Management System for a Fortune 500 client. The previous system for the client was not scalable and didn't perform well under a heavy traffic load. Our team's goal is to deliver a time-sensitive, full stack application with a modern React front-end communicating with a robust Express back-end.

This repository includes front-end and back-end made with my team of 4 developers.
